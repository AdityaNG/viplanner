# VIPlanner Visualization Node

Error
 [Open3D Error] (void open3d::visualization::gui::Application::Initialize(const char*)) ./cpp/open3d/visualization/gui/Application.cpp:256: Resource directory does not have Open3D resources: /usr/local/include/open3d/include/open3d/resources

Fix, copy resources from open3d python or directly take that directory (still don't know where they are with the normal installation - prob not compiled because of headless mode)


sudo apt install libpcl-dev
